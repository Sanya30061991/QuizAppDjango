# QuizAppDjango
Simple quiz app written on django
This time I've decided to create app without any help of bootstrap examples, so, that is the reason why this app is looking so strange, weak, and is not responsive.
The most hard part was about creating logic of this app (how to manipulate GET and POST data properly to achieve final goal).
All of the main functions and features of this app are contained in only 1 app directory, all of the functions and methods were written in Quiz/views.py file, used 3 models such
as User (Default model, so I have not counted it), UserResult, Quiz and Question.
I do not know how to work with foreign keys in django properly yet, so please do not blame me for using such an uneffective method to connect models between themselves.
In addiction I have tried to create this app following all of the PEP-8 recomendations (it was very hard).
